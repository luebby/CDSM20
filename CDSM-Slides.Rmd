## Intro: Inference from data analysis

Please take part in a (very) short survey: [https://bit.ly/30sJNbm](https://bit.ly/30sJNbm)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("img/Inferenz.jpg")
```

## What is infered?

Real SCM:

$$X_1 = U_{X_1}, \; U_{X_1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,10), \quad X_2 = -2X_1+U_{X_2}, \; U_{X_2} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,1),$$
$$Y = 5X_1+X_2+U_Y, \quad U_{Y} \sim  \mathcal{N}(0,\,5).$$

Based on OLS table with either excluding $x_1$, $\hat{\beta}^{(1)}_2=-1.505$, or including $\hat{\beta}^{(2)}_2=0.909$: 

*What do you think is the result on $y$ if you increase $x_2$ (by means of an intervention)?*

## Why we sould teach it?

.large[[EDC Oceans of Data Institute (2016)](http://oceansofdata.org/sites/oceansofdata.org/files/ODI%20Data%20Literacy%20Report_0.pdf):

The data-literate individual understands,  explains, and documents the utility and  limitations of data by becoming a critical consumer of data, controlling his/her personal data trail, finding meaning in data, and taking action based on data. The data-literate individual can identify, collect, evaluate, analyze, interpret, present, and protect data.]

# Teaching causal inference

## Call for action

.large[[Witmer (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00029890.2020.1671757): 

The  scientific  community  would  benefit  greatly  from  a  better  understanding of causal inference - and "better" is quite a low bar, given how little the tools of causal reasoning have been used over the years. But statisticians have stood in the way, insisting that cause-and-effect conclusions can only be drawn from randomized experiments and delighting in telling stories about confounded effects that arise when analyzing observational data, all while repeating the  mantra  that correlation is  not  causation. In so doing, we statisticians congratulate ourselves too much, while turning students away from asking and answering questions of genuine interest.]

## [Asking questions](https://askgoodquestions.blog/)

```{r, echo= FALSE , out.width = "15%", fig.align="center"}
ggplot() + geom_emoji("thinking") + theme_void()
```

- Is it a good idea to show oversimplified examples in class? Real causal inference is much harder.

- Are we overstraining our students?

- Simulated data, really?

- What about the topics ommited: Is causal inference making up the opportunity costs?

- What happens if our students change university and have learned different topics than in a consensus curriculum?

- Is it a good idea to teach something that most of us have not learned as a student?

- On the other hand, are we answering the important questions for data literacy in the consensus curriculum?
